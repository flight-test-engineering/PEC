This repository contains the notebooks featured in the International Standard Atmosphere (PEC/ISA) youtube mini-series.

The channel's homepage is [flighttestengineering](https://www.youtube.com/@flighttestengineering)

The mini-series has 3 parts:

* Part 1: plotting data from atmospheric sounding radiosonde - this includes a journey into large datasets plotting with [datashader](https://datashader.org/).
* Part 2: deriving the equations for the International Standard Atmosphere - including a small introduction to [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
* Part 3: implementing the equations in python, with stand-alone functions and on a module that can be easily imported into other notebooks

The associated notebooks are in this repo.

Enjoy!
