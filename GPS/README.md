This repository contains the notebooks featured in the PEC/GPS youtube mini-series.

The channel's homepage is [flighttestengineering](https://www.youtube.com/@flighttestengineering)

Each method is split in 2 videos, one that will explore the concepts and math and the follow-on, where the Python code is developed.

The first is the Geometric Method, described in AC 23-8C, where GPS data taken in 3 different headings is used to calculate the position error correction.
Its videos are: [Geometric Method Math](https://youtu.be/oo5wOAyhb0o) and [Geometric Method Code](https://youtu.be/BWwAG79eG34)

There is a common video that covers only [FAR 25 compliance](https://youtu.be/W96lvjsy-68) and this common code is part of all 3 notebooks

The second method covered is the Matrix Inversion, where the solution for $\Delta V$ is obtained by iteratively solving the set of non-linear equations.
The videos are [Matrix Inversion Math](https://youtu.be/DHZwEPLlQvk) and [Matrix Inversion Code](https://youtu.be/aklHzP3Iz5c)

Last, the Turn Regression is presented, where instead of flying in 3 different headings, a stabilized turn is used to collect data.
The origins of this method was proposed in 2010 by Al Lawless as the "Orbis Method".
The videos are [Turn Regression Math](https://youtu.be/cWcys_DgYck) and [Turn Regression Code](https://youtu.be/GgVREjdOfAs)
